      Fortitude is architected around one
      simple principle: keep developers out of
      the css and provide them with a
      consistent API to compose views, all in
      markup.

    title: Vertical Rhythm
    body: >
      Good vertical rhythm guides the user's
      gaze comfortably through your content by
      ensuring consistent, predictable vertical
      spacing between all elements. Everything
      in Fortitude respects a base vertical unit
      of size, Doing The Math For You™

    title: BEM Naming Conventions
    body: >
      block__element--modifier syntax keeps
      you out of the documentation and in the
      markup. Fortitude classes follow
      consistent conventions. You'll be amazed
      at how often you 'guess right' at the class
      you need. For more, check out this article

      BEM syntax by Harry Roberts

    title: Don’t fight the cascade
    body: >
      Fortitude classes apply the styles you want without a ridiculous incomprehensible tree of 'inheritance'. When you need new functionality, extending Fortitude is a breeze, and you won't spend time playing wack-a-mole in your CSS if you follow the fortitude conventions outlined here

    title: Build however you want
    body: >
      Unlike <mocking>soooome</mocking> frameworks, Fortitude doesn't get into your way. You think in visual styles instead of abstract component names, and we don't dump an entire visual codebase into your project. It's up to you to establish a visual theme with a designer or a tool like Adobe Kuler
